# Statistical Programming

This repo collects notes and Python implementations of various statistic
algorithms. Contents are derived from the class notes in STATS 202A at UCLA. 

## Table of contents 

* Linear regression
    - Sweep operator
    - QR decomposition
    
(Contents and this list will be updated along the way.)

## Are these implementations efficient?

Not necessarily at this point. The main purpose is to introduce these
algorithms and applications.

## Why IPython Notebook?

IPython Notebook is a awesome tool for mixing contents and executable codes in 
one single note. Even better, Markdown and LaTeX syntax is supported.
It is particular useful here because the contents are derived from lectures.
Apart from the implementations, I also include contents describing algorithms
and the applications. 

## How to view the notes?

To open locally, start ipython notebook after you clone the repo.
