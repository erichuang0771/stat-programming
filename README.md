# Statistical Programming

This repo collects notes and Python implementations of various statistic
algorithms. Contents are derived from the class notes of STATS 202A at UCLA
instructed by Professor Yingnian Wu.
I am one of the students who authored the code used in class,
Yixin Zhu and Siyuan Qi also contributed to the python code.

## Table of contents

(Contents and this table will be updated along the way.)

* Linear regression
    - Sweep operator
    - QR decomposition
* Principle component analysis
* Logistic regression (to be uploaded)
* Neural Network (to be uploaded)

## How to view the notes?

To view online: http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/hang-qi/stat-programming/tree/master/

To run it locally, start ipython notebook after you clone the repo.

    ipython notebook

## Why IPython Notebook?

IPython Notebook is a awesome tool for mixing contents and executable codes in
one single note. Even better, Markdown and LaTeX syntax is supported.
It is particular useful here because the contents are derived from lectures.
Apart from the implementations, I also include contents describing algorithms
and the applications.

## Are these implementations efficient?

Not necessarily at this point.
In fact, efficient implementations of many of these fundamentals algorithms
are packed in linear algebra routines like LAPACK and BLAS.
The main purpose here is to introduce the idea behind these algorithms
and address applications.

## Can I contribute?

You are welcome to contribute to these notes!

### File issues

If you find any mistakes or bugs about these notes, 
or you have any suggestions,
you can [submit issues here](https://github.com/hang-qi/stat-programming/issues).

### Make contributions

There are a lot of things you can do to make these notes better,
just to name a few:

* improve the narration of contents
* correct typos and mistakes
* fix bugs in code examples
* refine code examples
* add plots to the notes or code examples
* improve the format of the notes

As the class is still on going, new notes will be added in a periodical manner,
usually around one week after the lecture.
